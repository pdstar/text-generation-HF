# Text Generation Using Hugging Face
Apply Hugging Face pre-trained tokenizers to tokenize text, then use a basic PyTorch RNN to generate text, repeating the process with different tokenization strategies.

## Key Steps:
* Create tokenizer that will create tokens by character
* Train an RNN to generate text ysing character-based tokenizer
* Generate text with a character-base model
* Load a Hugging Face pretrained tokenizer (using subwork tokenization)
* Train an RNN to generate text using subwork-based tokenizer
* Generate text with a subword-based model
